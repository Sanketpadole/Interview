//
//	Daemon thread in Java is a low-priority thread that runs in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection. Daemon thread in Java is also a service provider thread that provides services to the user thread. Its life depends on the mercy of user threads i.e. when all the user threads die, JVM terminates this thread automatically.
//
//	In simple words, we can say that it provides services to user threads for background supporting tasks. It has no role in life other than to serve user threads.

//
//	FINALIZE-METHOD
//
//
//
//
//	The Java finalize() method of Object class is a method that the Garbage Collector always calls just before the deletion/destroying the object which is eligible
//	for Garbage Collection to perform clean-up activity. Clean-up activity means closing the resources associated with that object like
//	Database Connection, Network Connection, or we can say resource de-allocation.
//	Remember, it is not a reserved keyword. Once the finalize() method completes immediately, Garbage Collector destroys that object.
